# Applescript
AppleScript is a powerful and versatile scripting language for automating tasks on Apple devices. Unlike Shortcuts, which is a visual automation tool, AppleScript allows you to write code that can perform complex tasks and interact with other applications. These scripts are also easy to integrate with bash scripts (see [timedSend.sh](https://github.com/JosephManni/applescript/timedSend.sh) ). ~Drag and drop automation~, seriously? You're a **developer**, so let's tackle automation with some *actual code*!
